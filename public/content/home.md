# About Me

Hello, Internet! My name is Alex, and I’ve spent the last 4+ years working in
tech in roles ranging from startup founder and advisor to full-stack data
developer.

After completing a Master's in Applied Physics, I transitioned my career from
academia to data science and analytics. I taught myself machine learning and
took on the role of Chief Technical Officer at Armada IQ, where I built the
initial MVPs for a perception pipeline to measure driving behavior.

While doing this, I also supported students and startup founders through private
tutoring and advising. I’ve worked with students from high school to graduate
levels, focusing on helping them master physics and machine learning with
Python. This experience ignited a passion for mentorship and helping others
solve challenging problems.

Currently, I work at Level Agency, where I build and maintain internal
applications that empower media analysts to measure advertising performance
across multiple reporting levels.

I started this journey fascinated by how machine learning and AI could be used
to solve problems. Over the years, I’ve fallen in love with all facets of
technology—from developing frontend applications to understanding how Linux
works and diving deep into operating systems and memory management. My drive is
to continually learn, explore, and master all areas of tech.

This site will serve as a place to document what I’m learning, showcase my
projects, and share knowledge. I hope anyone who stumbles upon it finds
something useful, inspiring, or valuable.
